Tianji is a deterministic, time-based entropy source designed to inject **predictable personality variance** into LLMs.

## 🚀 Features
* **Machine-Optimized Schema**: Returns `conflict_level`, not horoscopes.
* **Zero Latency**: O(1) complexity.
* **Stability Windows**: Signals are stable for 2-hour blocks.

## 📦 Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
